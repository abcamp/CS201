#### Load in libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
```

#### Read in Dataset

```{r}
mtcars <- datasets::mtcars

# read about the data
?mtcars
```

Let's examine the relationship between weight and miles per gallon

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

```{r}
# both of these should work
mtcars_t <- mtcars %>%
  rownames_to_column("model")

mtcars_t2 <- mtcars %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column("model")
```

```{r}
basic_regression <- lm(wt ~ mpg, data = mtcars)
summary(basic_regression)

slope <- coef(basic_regression)[["mpg"]]
intercept <- coef(basic_regression)[["(Intercept)"]]

ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope)
```

```{r}
cars_wt_mpg <- ggplot(data = mtcars_t, aes(x = mpg, y = wt, point = model, color = hp)) + 
  geom_point() 
  

ggplotly(cars_wt_mpg)
```
